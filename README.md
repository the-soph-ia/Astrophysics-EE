## Welcome to my EE repository!
My Research Question:
> What correlations exist between the mass of a planet and the eccentricity of its orbit?

This repository contains:
- 18 csv files containing data tables:
- - "data.csv" is the main file; everything else is broken down from that
- 2 Python script files that processes the data + generate the graphs
    
All data was extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
