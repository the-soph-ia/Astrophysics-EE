## Welcome to my EE repository!
My Research Question:
> What correlations exist between the mass and density of a planet and the eccentricity of its orbit?

This repository contains:
- 4 csv files containing data tables:
- - "data.csv" is the main file; everything else is broken down from that
- 1 "script" Python file that processes the data
- the ✨magic✨ of learning
    
Comments from data.csv (extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive):
